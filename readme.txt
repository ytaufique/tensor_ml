This is a test environment for a pytorch based project to classify stellar objects from the GAIA survey. Techniques employed are based on
Rimoldini et al. (2023) ((machine learning classification of variable sources)). Using a smaller training, and validation set. Instead
of general classification, this project focuses on hot white dwarfs.
